How to quickly test:

- It's recommended to compile tests with interceptor enabled, so enable it!
- By default, UniverseLAN DLL is used by a test
- You can drag & drop the test.exe onto the .bat files for User1 and User2, it will use the credentials for that user when using the interceptor
- After running ULAN and GOG variants of a single test, you can compare the runs by comparing the interceptor tracing files in UniverseLANData/Interceptor/Tracing
